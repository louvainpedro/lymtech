          <h3>How Netflix Changed the Course of Cloud Computing</h3>
          <p class="mb">
            <br />
            In recent decades, the audiovisual entertainment market has
            undergone drastic changes with the advent of streaming platforms.
            Not long ago, watching a movie required following the schedule of a
            television channel, going to the cinema, or even buying or renting a
            DVD containing the film.
            <br /><br />For those of us who are older, we used to go to
            Blockbuster to rent one or two movies on VHS and later on DVD (that
            was the plan for the weekend). With the evolution of technology and
            streaming, these companies began to close.<br /><br />
            Following a TV series was a ritual: being at home at the same time
            each week so as not to miss an episode. Episodes were released
            weekly, so if you missed one, you would disconnect from the
            storyline. Before each episode, programs offered a summary of what
            had happened previously, a kind of lifesaver for the distracted.
            That's how television was before streaming.<br /><br />
            But as everyone knows, that's no longer the reality of the
            entertainment segment. Users have various applications on their
            televisions, computers, tablets, and even smartphones, enabling them
            to access thousands of movies and TV series.<br /><br />
          </p>

          <section class="logo-e-texto">
            <img
              class="imagem-logo-da-netflix"
              loading="lazy"
              src="../assets/img/images-blog/img-post-9-netflix.png"
            />
            <p class="texto-a-direita-da-imagem">
              However, I imagine you, dear reader, may be wondering:<br />
              how is this possible? How did technology achieve something as
              amazing as this?
            </p>
          </section>

          <h3>
            Netflix is a company founded in 1997 in the USA, and its services
            consisted of renting DVDs by mail.
          </h3>

          <p class="mb">
            In summary, the operation method was as follows: the user accessed
            the Netflix website and selected the DVDs they wanted to rent. After
            that, they provided the desired delivery address, and that was it!
            In a few days, the DVD arrived at their home, and to return it, they
            simply sent the DVDs back with some return documents to the
            company's address. That's how Netflix achieved significant success
            in the United States.<br /><br />
            With the progress of computational technology and the ability to
            watch videos in general, Netflix dreamed big and invested in a
            platform that could accommodate thousands of movies and series in
            its catalog, available with the payment of a low-cost monthly
            subscription.<br /><br />
            The idea was great, but over time and with the company's exponential
            growth, the costs to maintain the Datacenters (which are nothing
            more than sites that house computers containing the data and
            technological infrastructure of the company) increased, and so
            Netflix revolutionized once again.<br /><br />
          </p>

          <h3>A NEW ERA</h3>
          <p class="mb">
            Today, virtually all users of modern technology have at least heard
            the word "cloud" in the context of memory. With this "cloud" tool,
            it is easy to store gigabytes and more gigabytes of important data,
            only needing to create an account on a platform that provides these
            services, such as Google Drive, OneDrive (Microsoft), iCloud
            (Apple), and many others.<br /><br />
            However, many do not know exactly what "cloud" technology is. This
            is known as Cloud Computing, and it has existed long before these
            platforms, with its first citation in a lecture in 1997 (born in the
            same year as Netflix), but it was in 2006 that the Cloud entered the
            market, with the emergence of AWS - Amazon Web Services (yes, it is
            a service offered by Amazon).<br /><br />
            <img
              class="imagem-aws"
              loading="lazy"
              src="../assets/img/images-blog/image-post-9-netflix-aws.png"
            /><br />

            In 2008, Netflix faced a major problem: the huge number of requests
            to its data centers caused the databases to fail and stop, leading
            to the company's services being interrupted for 3 days; it was a
            disaster.<br /><br />
            The decision to move their operations to the cloud has been
            validated by Netflix's overwhelming success today. By January 2024,
            the platform has reached an impressive milestone of 260.28 million
            subscriber users worldwide. Additionally, Netflix reported a profit
            of $2.3 billion in just the first quarter of that year. The
            company's global expansion is notable, being present in 190
            countries and offering a vast library of content tailored to various
            cultures and local preferences. This strategic shift to the cloud
            has not only allowed Netflix to improve the quality and availability
            of its service but also to constantly innovate its content offerings
            and user experience. The flexibility and scalability provided by AWS
            have been crucial in sustaining the company's exponential growth and
            its ability to handle demand spikes during significant events, such
            as the release of new seasons of popular series.<br /><br />
            In summary, the migration to AWS's cloud has been essential to
            Netflix's success, allowing it to quickly adapt to changing market
            demands and maintain its leadership in the digital entertainment
            industry.<br /><br />

          <p class="mb">
            In conclusion, Netflix's success is due to its ability to understand
            the changing needs of the market and, above all, the needs and
            preferences of its users. By adopting cloud computing technology,
            Netflix not only adapted to new technological paradigms but also
            innovated and charted its own path to corporate success. Its
            customer-centric approach and its ability to lead in a constantly
            evolving market are clear testaments to its bold vision and
            commitment to excellence. Ultimately, Netflix has not only redefined
            how we consume entertainment but also set a standard of innovation
            and adaptability that will continue to inspire companies
            worldwide.<br /><br />
          </p>

          <h3>IMPACTS ON THE MARKET</h3>
          <p class="mb">
            The success and influence of Netflix are reflected in the
            audiovisual market to this day, so much so that the largest
            television channels in the world, institutions of all kinds, and
            even religious groups have streaming channels.<br /><br />
            It is no coincidence that Disney has launched Star+ and Disney+,
            with segmented and organized content to reach all audiences. HBO
            also did not stay behind and launched HBO Max, a streaming platform
            that contains content from Cartoon Network, DC Comics, and original
            HBO content. There are streaming platforms for soccer clubs,
            religious content, and even public institutions. This modality of
            entertainment and dissemination of information has drastically
            changed the methods of consuming programs, all thanks to the
            brilliance and innovation of Netflix.<br /><br />
            Currently, there are hundreds of cases or small platforms that
            stream or are trying to reach that point. Mercado Livre is starting
            to offer movies, for now, for free, which suggests that it will
            become another streaming platform. Enlace TV, a company that offers
            a wide variety of videos with the word of God and even has rooms for
            online prayer. The phenomenon of streaming platforms has come to
            definitively change television entertainment in all social and
            market layers. Thanks to technology, access to and the way of
            consuming audiovisual content have evolved significantly, allowing
            for unprecedented personalization and convenience for users. Without
            technology, these changes would not have been possible.<br /><br />
            One of the most important factors of these platforms is the
            integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and the focus on the
            user experience. AI allows streaming platforms to offer personalized
            recommendations based on the user's viewing history, preferences,
            and behaviors. This level of personalization means that users can
            decide what and when they want to watch content, making the
            experience much more intuitive and satisfying.<br /><br />
            In addition to streaming giants like Netflix, Amazon Prime, and
            Disney+, other companies are entering this market. A notable example
            is Mercado Libre, which has started offering free movies within its
            platform. This move demonstrates how companies are recognizing the
            importance of streaming and are seeking to offer additional services
            to attract and retain users.<br /><br />
            In conclusion, technology, marketing, and artificial intelligence
            are advancing towards a world where the user experience is the
            central focus. Streaming platforms have not only transformed the way
            we consume entertainment but are also influencing other industries
            to adopt similar user-centric models. This change represents a
            significant evolution in the market, where innovation and
            adaptability are key to success.
