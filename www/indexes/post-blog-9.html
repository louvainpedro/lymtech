            How Netflix Changed the Course of Cloud Computing

              In recent decades, the audiovisual entertainment market has
              undergone drastic changes with the advent of streaming platforms.
              Not long ago, watching a movie required following the schedule of
              a television channel, going to the cinema, or even buying or
              renting a DVD containing the film.
            </span>
            <br /><br /><span data-i18n="text2-content-blog-post9">
              For those of us who are older, we used to go to Blockbuster to
              rent one or two movies on VHS and later on DVD (that was the plan
              for the weekend). With the evolution of technology and streaming,
              these companies began to close. </span
            ><br /><br />
            <span data-i18n="text3-content-blog-post9">
              Following a TV series was a ritual: being at home at the same time
              each week so as not to miss an episode. Episodes were released
              weekly, so if you missed one, you would disconnect from the
              storyline. Before each episode, programs offered a summary of what
              had happened previously, a kind of lifesaver for the distracted.
              That's how television was before streaming. </span
            ><br /><br />
            <span data-i18n="text4-content-blog-post9">
              But as everyone knows, that's no longer the reality of the
              entertainment segment. Users have various applications on their
              televisions, computers, tablets, and even smartphones, enabling
              them to access thousands of movies and TV series. </span

            Netflix is a company founded in 1997 in the USA, and its services
            consisted of renting DVDs by mail.

          <p class="mb">
            <span data-i18n="text9-content-blog-post9">
              In summary, the operation method was as follows: the user accessed
              the Netflix website and selected the DVDs they wanted to rent.
              After that, they provided the desired delivery address, and that
              was it! In a few days, the DVD arrived at their home, and to
              return it, they simply sent the DVDs back with some return
              documents to the company's address. That's how Netflix achieved
              significant success in the United States. </span
            ><br /><br />
            <span data-i18n="text10-content-blog-post9">
              With the progress of computational technology and the ability to
              watch videos in general, Netflix dreamed big and invested in a
              platform that could accommodate thousands of movies and series in
              its catalog, available with the payment of a low-cost monthly
              subscription. </span
            ><br /><br />
            <span data-i18n="text11-content-blog-post9">
              The idea was great, but over time and with the company's
              exponential growth, the costs to maintain the Datacenters (which
              are nothing more than sites that house computers containing the
              data and technological infrastructure of the company) increased,
              and so Netflix revolutionized once again. </span

              Today, virtually all users of modern technology have at least
              heard the word "cloud" in the context of memory. With this "cloud"
              tool, it is easy to store gigabytes and more gigabytes of
              important data, only needing to create an account on a platform
              that provides these services, such as Google Drive, OneDrive
              (Microsoft), iCloud (Apple), and many others. </span
            ><br /><br />
            <span data-i18n="text14-content-blog-post9">
              However, many do not know exactly what "cloud" technology is. This
              is known as Cloud Computing, and it has existed long before these
              platforms, with its first citation in a lecture in 1997 (born in
              the same year as Netflix), but it was in 2006 that the Cloud
              entered the market, with the emergence of AWS - Amazon Web
              Services (yes, it is a service offered by Amazon). </span

              In 2008, Netflix faced a major problem: the huge number of
              requests to its data centers caused the databases to fail and
              stop, leading to the company's services being interrupted for 3
              days; it was a disaster. </span
            ><br /><br />
            <span data-i18n="text17-content-blog-post9">
              The decision to move their operations to the cloud has been
              validated by Netflix's overwhelming success today. By January
              2024, the platform has reached an impressive milestone of 260.28
              million subscriber users worldwide. Additionally, Netflix reported
              a profit of $2.3 billion in just the first quarter of that year.
              The company's global expansion is notable, being present in 190
              countries and offering a vast library of content tailored to
              various cultures and local preferences. This strategic shift to
              the cloud has not only allowed Netflix to improve the quality and
              availability of its service but also to constantly innovate its
              content offerings and user experience. The flexibility and
              scalability provided by AWS have been crucial in sustaining the
              company's exponential growth and its ability to handle demand
              spikes during significant events, such as the release of new
              seasons of popular series. </span

              In summary, the migration to AWS's cloud has been essential to

            In conclusion, Netflix's success is due to its ability to understand
            the changing needs of the market and, above all, the needs and
            preferences of its users. By adopting cloud computing technology,
            Netflix not only adapted to new technological paradigms but also
            innovated and charted its own path to corporate success. Its
            customer-centric approach and its ability to lead in a constantly
            evolving market are clear testaments to its bold vision and
            commitment to excellence. Ultimately, Netflix has not only redefined
            how we consume entertainment but also set a standard of innovation
            and adaptability that will continue to inspire companies
            worldwide.<br /><br />

            <span data-i18n="text22-content-blog-post9">
              The success and influence of Netflix are reflected in the
              audiovisual market to this day, so much so that the largest
              television channels in the world, institutions of all kinds, and
              even religious groups have streaming channels. </span
            ><br /><br />
            <span data-i18n="text23-content-blog-post9">
              It is no coincidence that Disney has launched Star+ and Disney+,
              with segmented and organized content to reach all audiences. HBO
              also did not stay behind and launched HBO Max, a streaming
              platform that contains content from Cartoon Network, DC Comics,
              and original HBO content. There are streaming platforms for soccer
              clubs, religious content, and even public institutions. This
              modality of entertainment and dissemination of information has
              drastically changed the methods of consuming programs, all thanks
              to the brilliance and innovation of Netflix. </span

            <span data-i18n="text24-content-blog-post9">
              Currently, there are hundreds of cases or small platforms that
              stream or are trying to reach that point. Mercado Livre is
              starting to offer movies, for now, for free, which suggests that
              it will become another streaming platform. Enlace TV, a company
              that offers a wide variety of videos with the word of God and even
              has rooms for online prayer. The phenomenon of streaming platforms
              has come to definitively change television entertainment in all
              social and market layers. Thanks to technology, access to and the
              way of consuming audiovisual content have evolved significantly,
              allowing for unprecedented personalization and convenience for
              users. Without technology, these changes would not have been
              possible. </span

            <span data-i18n="text25-content-blog-post9">
              One of the most important factors of these platforms is the
              integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and the focus on the
              user experience. AI allows streaming platforms to offer
              personalized recommendations based on the user's viewing history,
              preferences, and behaviors. This level of personalization means
              that users can decide what and when they want to watch content,
              making the experience much more intuitive and satisfying. </span
            ><br /><br />
            <span data-i18n="text26-content-blog-post9">
              In addition to streaming giants like Netflix, Amazon Prime, and
              Disney+, other companies are entering this market. A notable
              example is Mercado Libre, which has started offering free movies
              within its platform. This move demonstrates how companies are
              recognizing the importance of streaming and are seeking to offer
              additional services to attract and retain users. </span
            ><br /><br />
            <span data-i18n="text28-content-blog-post9">
              In conclusion, technology, marketing, and artificial intelligence
              are advancing towards a world where the user experience is the
              central focus. Streaming platforms have not only transformed the
              way we consume entertainment but are also influencing other
              industries to adopt similar user-centric models. This change
              represents a significant evolution in the market, where innovation
              and adaptability are key to success.
