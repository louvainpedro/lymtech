          <h3>SEO OR NOT SEO, THAT IS THE QUESTION</h3>
          <p>

Trying to begin this post in a relaxed way for our dear readers and based on the topic to which we will address, we begin by paraphrasing the famous work of William 
Shakespeare -Hamlet, Prince of Denmark <strong>“To be or not to be, that is the question”</strong> This phrase is the first line of a monologue by the character Hamlet. The phrase is 
considered one of the most famous in universal literature.<br><br>

SEO for those who do not know what it is, we will take a definition from the book <strong>THE AVC OF DIGITAL MARKETING</strong> by Raquel Oberlander and Roi Shahaf. SEO,” a series of 
actions that aim to improve the positioning of a website in a search engine. The better a site is positioned, in the first places of the results, the greater number of 
views it will receive” Planeta Edition- Montevideo-Uruguay - Second edition February 2023.<br><br>

So, after breaking the ice. SEO or not SEO. Years ago it was said that SEO would disappear, but how many times have we entered a page where the content is bad or does 
not directly represent what we are looking for.<br><br>

<strong>RELEVANCE and AUTHORITY</strong> are two important words to generate organic content on the web, these concepts translate into whether our readers recommend and consider 
RELEVANCE what we publish or post on the web-social networks.<br><br>

SEO tries to optimize our content based on a number of techniques and tools that will help us to ensure that algorithms or search engines find thousands quickly. 
organically, (without paying) that's what Google ads is for. Google ads is a platform that allows you to pay for ads to position your service or product, paying through
 what is defined as PPC or cost per click.<br><br>

There are different types of campaigns within the platform such as: Search campaign, display campaign and Google Shoppoing. We gave this brief definition so that you 
can roughly differentiate what Google Ads and what SEO does. We will address the world of paid ads in another blog post.<br><br>

Returning to the topic we came to develop, SEO specifically involves what we know in digital marketing as Key Words, this refers to how our users search, what questions
 they ask when searching, as we mentioned at the beginning of this post. , relevance and authority.<br><br>

There are different tools that allow us to verify how the user searches. Example 
<a href="https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/keyword-surfer/bafijghppfhdpldihckdcadbcobikaca" target="_blank" style="color: #007bff; text-decoration: underline;" >Keyword Surfer</a>
(a Chrome extension). When entering any keyword it will return two 
numbers. The first indicates the total of global searches throughout the world, and the second the volume in the region that you indicate.<br><br>

Here we leave a small image of basic and free tools to search for keywords. This happens when ideas run out and we have to turn to technology to support us. In my 
opinion, common sense also plays a lot here since you are also a buyer, you would be surprised to see how users search. Spelling mistakes play a major role or the 
misspelled brand name can affect how the user searches for us.<br><br>

<br><br>  

Users search for information on the Internet to satisfy their needs or to find solutions to a specific problem, purchase a product, contract a service, among others. 
In general terms, searches can be divided into three types:<br><br>
✔Informational search: The user searches for information on a specific topic.<br><br>
✔Navigational search: The user wants to visit a specific site or page.<br><br>
✔Commercial search: The user wants to buy a product or service.<br><br>
✔Search intents typically match where users are in the marketing funnel:
Awareness: The user searches for informative keywords.<br><br>
✔Consideration: The user searches for commercial keywords.<br><br>
✔Conversion: User searches for transactional or navigational keywords<br><br>

Three Phases that help positioning:
<br><br>
<img class="imagem imagem-2"
     loading="lazy"
     src="../assets/img/images-blog/img-post-10-2.png"/>
<br><br>
Written content is a very important factor in SEO, but so are images. There is the ALT attribute that is used to include descriptive text on an image, providing 
information about its appearance, essential if it does not load correctly on our website. It helps our SEO to provide as <strong>much information as possible to Google</strong> so that 
it can <strong>understand</strong> our content and, therefore,<strong>show</strong> it to users.<br><br>

Another important factor to have good functioning at a basic level of SEO on our website is that the robots.txt file is correct. This is a plain text file that tells 
earch engine crawlers which URLs on a site they can access. Robots.txt files are part of the Robot Exclusion Protocol (REP), a group of web standards that regulate how 
robots crawl, access, and index content.<br><br>

Links are essential for web navigation, they allow users to jump from one page to another and navigate sites effectively.<br><br>

Links are important for web positioning, since they provide information to search engines about the content and objective of the page, helping the search engine to 
position it appropriately. In an adequate digital marketing strategy, you must consider the optimal combination of internal, external and incoming links, in order to 
keep the site optimized and improve the user experience.<br><br>
<img class="imagem imagem-3"
     loading="lazy"
     src="../assets/img/images-blog/img-post-10-3.png"/>
 <br><br>
Links also provide navigation paths for spiders or robots, but more importantly, for visitors. These routes tell robots which content or important sites we want to index.<br><br>

This <strong>hreflang</strong> attribute is an HTML programming language element that tells search engines the target language and region of a web page. This allows search engines, 
such as Google, to show users the most appropriate version of the page based on their language and country preferences.<br><br>
<img class="imagem imagem-4"
     loading="lazy"
     src="../assets/img/images-blog/img-post-10-4.png"/>
 <br><br>

<strong>Hreflang</strong> is important in SEO, it helps ensure that the right audience visits our page. For example, in Uruguay and Argentina there is a company called BuqueBus (Ferrie),
 this company is dedicated to transporting people between the two countries.<br><br>
Here those who enter from one country or another can view the prices in the currency that corresponds to each one, it seems something simple but extremely important 
for our users. In order to implement hreflang, you must place as many tags as your website has languages ​​in the <head> of the web page.<br><br>
Another of the basic aspects that we have been developing within this small document to introduce us to the basics of the world of SEO is the on page.<br><br>
On-page SEO is a set of techniques applied to a web page to improve positioning in both content and HTML code. It focuses on optimizing internal elements such as: 
Titles, Meta descriptions, Use of keywords, Loading speed, Content quality, all key elements for good positioning and organic growth.<br><br>
It is good to mention that SEO takes months to bear fruit or rather for us to be able to see the results.<br><br>
On-page SEO is different from off-page SEO, which encompasses anything that can be optimized outside the web to improve ranking. Backlinks, social media, and public 
relations are examples of off-page SEO.<br><br>

<strong>Some tips to improve on-page SEO are:</strong><br><br>
✔Search and select the ideal keywords (make a list of words that you consider relevant to your search - see the competition)<br>
✔Optimize the title and description of the page (Clear titles that refer to the product or service you offer)<br>
✔Create friendly URLs - avoid superfluous words and create a URL like: example.com /products/sneakers/summer<br>
✔Optimize header tags for keywords<br>
✔Create quality and optimized content (authentic and relevant content for users)
Content sitemap to Google<br>
<br>
<img class="imagem imagem-5"
     loading="lazy"
     src="../assets/img/images-blog/img-post-10-5.png"/>
                <br><br>
Off Page SEO is a set of practices that help the positioning of our page. Actions that make our page have authority, in short, improve the Page Rank. To do this, a 
series of actions must be carried out that make different links come to our page or what is known in digital marketing as linkbuiding.<br><br>
A strategy to achieve this that is frequently used today is that of influencers, another may be customer ratings, podcasts, blogs, are other types of tools that 
generate this type of link construction that is directed to our page. Off-page SEO, if we have many views we will have a good positioning of our page and it will help 
us position ourselves.<br><br>
Other sites recommend my page and link to my page. Google will perceive that our page has quality content and our ranking will increase. You have to be very careful 
which pages they recommend (tell me who you are with and I will tell you who you are). Search robots see this and if the pages that link to us are bad, our reputation 
will also be bad and our SEO will not improve.<br><br>
Another example could be that we are mentioned in the press or in a news story. This also makes what is known as off-page SEO.<br><br><br>

We have been covering almost all the basics when it comes to SEO. Another fundamental aspect is to always review the Site performance. Personally, I use a page
<a href="https://pagespeed.web.dev/" target="_blank" style="color: #007bff;">https://pagespeed.web.dev/</a> that gives good information about the possible errors that our website may present 
and creates a detailed report of how we are doing in some factors such as speed, performance and SEO. These reports are not for our analysis, but for that of the 
developers.<br><br>


 <img class="imagem imagem-6"

                 <br>
In addition to providing the report to the developer in the image we see above, we can observe in the following image the performance of our website or that of a 
friend, which we will not reveal to improve not only in SEO but in almost all aspects of which we have been mentioning in this humble blogpost.
<br><br>

<br>

This brief summary of some very basic SEO concepts is intended to help those who are primarily beginning to correctly position a web page. Organic, natural, useful 
for the user and quality (authentic) content is important. A simple and easy to navigate page, with titles that refer to what is offered, whether it is a product or
 service so that, ultimately, they can find us easily.
