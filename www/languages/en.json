After that, they provided the desired delivery address, and that was it! In a few days, the DVD arrived at their home, and to return it, they simply sent the DVDs back with some return documents to the company's address. That's how Netflix achieved significant success in the United States.",
    "text10-content-blog-post9": "With the progress of computational technology and the ability to watch videos in general, Netflix dreamed big and invested in a platform that could accommodate thousands of movies and series in its catalog, available with the payment of a low-cost monthly subscription.",
    "text11-content-blog-post9": "The idea was great, but over time and with the company's exponential growth, the costs to maintain the Datacenters (which are nothing more than sites that house computers containing the data and technological infrastructure of the company) increased, and so Netflix revolutionized once again.",

    "text13-content-blog-post9": "Today, virtually all users of modern technology have at least heard the word 'cloud' in the context of memory.

    "text14-content-blog-post9": "However, many do not know exactly what 'cloud' technology is. This is known as Cloud Computing, and it has existed long before these platforms, with its first citation in a lecture in 1997 (born in the same year as Netflix), but it was in 2006 that the Cloud entered the market, with the emergence of AWS - Amazon Web Services (yes, it is a service offered by Amazon).",
    "text16-content-blog-post9": "In 2008, Netflix faced a major problem: the huge number of requests to its data centers caused the databases to fail and stop, leading to the company's services being interrupted for 3 days; it was a disaster.",
    "text17-content-blog-post9": "The decision to move their operations to the cloud has been validated by Netflix's overwhelming success today. By January 2024, the platform has reached an impressive milestone of 260.28 million subscriber users worldwide. Additionally, Netflix reported a profit of $2.3 billion in just the first quarter of that year. The company's global expansion is notable, being present in 190 countries and offering a vast library of content tailored to various cultures and local preferences. This strategic shift to the cloud has not only allowed Netflix to improve the quality and availability of its service but also to constantly innovate its content offerings and user experience. The flexibility and scalability provided by AWS have been crucial in sustaining the company's exponential growth and its ability to handle demand spikes during significant events, such as the release of new seasons of popular series.",

By adopting cloud computing technology, Netflix not only adapted to new technological paradigms but also innovated and charted its own path to corporate success. Its customer-centric approach and its ability to lead in a  evolving market are clear testaments to its bold vision and commitment to excellence. Ultimately, Netflix has not only redefined how we consume entertainment but also set a standard of innovation and adaptability that will continue to inspire companies worldwide.",

HBO also did not stay behind and launched HBO Max, a streaming platform that contains content from Cartoon Network, DC Comics, and original HBO content. There are streaming platforms for soccer clubs, religious content, and even public institutions. This modality of entertainment and dissemination of information has drastically changed the methods of consuming programs, all thanks to the brilliance and innovation of Netflix.",
    "text24-content-blog-post9": "Currently, there are hundreds of cases or small platforms that stream or are trying to reach that point. Mercado Livre is startingto offer movies, for now, for free, which suggests that it will become another streaming platform. Enlace TV, a company that offers a wide variety of videos with the word of God and even has rooms for online prayer. The phenomenon of streaming platforms has come to definitively change television entertainment in all social and market layers. Thanks to technology, access to and the way of consuming audiovisual content have evolved significantly, allowing for unprecedented personalization and convenience for users. Without technology, these changes would not have been possible.",
    "text25-content-blog-post9": "One of the most important factors of these platforms is the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and the focus on the user experience. AI allows streaming platforms to offer personalized recommendations based on the user's viewing history, preferences, and behaviors. This level of personalization means that users can decide what and when they want to watch content, making the experience much more intuitive and satisfying.",
    "text26-content-blog-post9": "In addition to streaming giants like Netflix, Amazon Prime, and Disney+, other companies are entering this market. A notable example is Mercado Libre, which has started offering free movies within its platform. This move demonstrates how companies are recognizing the importance of streaming and are seeking to offer additional services to attract and retain users.",
    "text28-content-blog-post9": "In conclusion, technology, marketing, and artificial intelligence are advancing towards a world where the user experience is the central focus.

    "text3-content-blog-post11": "The objective of visiting two Harley Davison executives was to learn the sophisticated techniques and technologies that Honda used to make its motorcycles cheaper. To surprise this entourage of dressed-up executives, there were no robberies in the factory, no computers, no type of high-tech device, nothing that, at first glance, attributed a substantial advantage over or that we already knew. What we found in our place was a team of 470 highly qualified collaborators, trained and organized, following protocols for testing and assembling all the machinery. Another detail is that your workers are very satisfied with the work they do inside the factory.",
    "text5-content-blog-post11": "A few years later, Harley Davidson began to grow from 23% to 46% of its share in the North American market. Foram registered profits of 17.7 million and their motorcycles will become the symbol of the American home, due to some excellent work in marketing and communication. The company committed to excellent two production processes, hiring the most qualified people, excellent two quality tests, among others. Not only did you learn how to do it, how it was longer, recognizing the problems you have in the assembly and design of your motorcycles.",
    "text6-content-blog-post11": "The Japanese continued to lead for several reasons. One of them was to know where we were going wrong and quickly correct the error. How are you faziam isso? Listen to your clients. Some of these problems, during the 80s, were more outstanding problems. Each time a item was manufactured, it was made in small batchesof surplus parts, which allowed us to assemble them in the factory and give a quick response when our customers needed them.",
    "text7-content-blog-post11": "What finally happened is that Harley Davidson was copied or “borrowed” the model developed by Honda Motors. By adopting this management model, combined with high quality controls, qualified people (mechanical engineers) in the production chain, a strong and energetic communication plan that covers all the territory of the United States, established Harley Davidson as a motorcycle by excellence of the American people.",
