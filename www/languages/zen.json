    "text1-content-blog-post9": "In recent decades, the audiovisual entertainment market has undergone drastic changes with the advent of streaming platforms. Not long ago, watching a movie required following the schedule of a television channel, going to the cinema, or even buying or renting a DVD containing the film.",
    "text2-content-blog-post9":"For those of us who are older, we used to go to Blockbuster to rent one or two movies on VHS and later on DVD (that was the plan for the weekend). With the evolution of technology and streaming, these companies began to close.",
    "text3-content-blog-post9":"Following a TV series was a ritual: being at home at the same time each week so as not to miss an episode. Episodes were released weekly, so if you missed one, you would disconnect from the storyline. Before each episode, programs offered a summary of what had happened previously, a kind of lifesaver for the distracted. That's how television was before streaming.",
    "text4-content-blog-post9":"But as everyone knows, that's no longer the reality of the entertainment segment. Users have various applications on their televisions, computers, tablets, and even smartphones, enabling them to access thousands of movies and TV series.",
    "text5-content-blog-post9":"However, I imagine you, dear reader, may be wondering:",
    "text7-content-blog-post9":"How is this possible? How did technology achieve something as amazing as this?",
    "text8-content-blog-post9":"Netflix is a company founded in 1997 in the USA, and its services consisted of renting DVDs by mail.",
    "text9-content-blog-post9":"In summary, the operation method was as follows: the user accessed the Netflix website and selected the DVDs they wanted to rent. After that, they provided the desired delivery address, and that was it! In a few days, the DVD arrived at their home, and to return it, they simply sent the DVDs back with some return documents to the company's address. That's how Netflix achieved significant success in the United States.",
    "text10-content-blog-post9":"With the progress of computational technology and the ability to watch videos in general, Netflix dreamed big and invested in a platform that could accommodate thousands of movies and series in its catalog, available with the payment of a low-cost monthly subscription.",
    "text11-content-blog-post9":"The idea was great, but over time and with the company's exponential growth, the costs to maintain the Datacenters (which are nothing more than sites that house computers containing the data and technological infrastructure of the company) increased, and so Netflix revolutionized once again.",
    "text12-content-blog-post9":"A NEW ERA",
    "text13-content-blog-post9":"Today, virtually all users of modern technology have at least heard the word 'cloud' in the context of memory. With this 'cloud' tool, it is easy to store gigabytes and more gigabytes of important data, only needing to create an account on a platform that provides these services, such as Google Drive, OneDrive (Microsoft), iCloud (Apple), and many others.",
    "text14-content-blog-post9":"However, many do not know exactly what 'cloud' technology is. This is known as Cloud Computing, and it has existed long before these platforms, with its first citation in a lecture in 1997 (born in the same year as Netflix), but it was in 2006 that the Cloud entered the market, with the emergence of AWS - Amazon Web Services (yes, it is a service offered by Amazon).",
    "text16-content-blog-post9":"In 2008, Netflix faced a major problem: the huge number of requests to its data centers caused the databases to fail and stop, leading to the company's services being interrupted for 3 days; it was a disaster.",
    "text17-content-blog-post9":"The decision to move their operations to the cloud has been validated by Netflix's overwhelming success today. By January 2024, the platform has reached an impressive milestone of 260.28 million subscriber users worldwide. Additionally, Netflix reported a profit of $2.3 billion in just the first quarter of that year. The company's global expansion is notable, being present in 190 countries and offering a vast library of content tailored to various cultures and local preferences. This strategic shift to the cloud has not only allowed Netflix to improve the quality and availability of its service but also to constantly innovate its content offerings and user experience. The flexibility and scalability provided by AWS have been crucial in sustaining the company's exponential growth and its ability to handle demand spikes during significant events, such as the release of new seasons of popular series.",
    "text18-content-blog-post9":" In summary, the migration to AWS's cloud has been essential to Netflix's success, allowing it to quickly adapt to changing market demands and maintain its leadership in the  entertainment industry.",
    "text19-content-blog-post9":"Netflix's first headquarters",
    "text20-content-blog-post9":"In conclusion, Netflix's success is due to its ability to understand the changing needs of the market and, above all, the needs and preferences of its users. By adopting cloud computing technology, Netflix not only adapted to new technological paradigms but also innovated and charted its own path to corporate success. Its customer-centric approach and its ability to lead in a  evolving market are clear testaments to its bold vision and commitment to excellence. Ultimately, Netflix has not only redefined how we consume entertainment but also set a standard of innovation and adaptability that will continue to inspire companies worldwide.",
    "text21-content-blog-post9":"IMPACTS ON THE MARKET",
    "text22-content-blog-post9":"The success and influence of Netflix are reflected in the audiovisual market to this day, so much so that the largest television channels in the world, institutions of all kinds, and even religious groups have streaming channels.",
    "text23-content-blog-post9":"It is no coincidence that Disney has launched Star+ and Disney+, with segmented and organized content to reach all audiences. HBO also did not stay behind and launched HBO Max, a streaming platform that contains content from Cartoon Network, DC Comics, and original HBO content. There are streaming platforms for soccer clubs, religious content, and even public institutions. This modality of entertainment and dissemination of information has drastically changed the methods of consuming programs, all thanks to the brilliance and innovation of Netflix.",
    "text24-content-blog-post9":"Currently, there are hundreds of cases or small platforms that stream or are trying to reach that point. Mercado Livre is startingto offer movies, for now, for free, which suggests that it will become another streaming platform. Enlace TV, a company that offers a wide variety of videos with the word of God and even has rooms for online prayer. The phenomenon of streaming platforms has come to definitively change television entertainment in all social and market layers. Thanks to technology, access to and the way of consuming audiovisual content have evolved significantly, allowing for unprecedented personalization and convenience for users. Without technology, these changes would not have been possible.",
    "text25-content-blog-post9":"One of the most important factors of these platforms is the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and the focus on the user experience. AI allows streaming platforms to offer personalized recommendations based on the user's viewing history, preferences, and behaviors. This level of personalization means that users can decide what and when they want to watch content, making the experience much more intuitive and satisfying.",
    "text26-content-blog-post9":"In addition to streaming giants like Netflix, Amazon Prime, and Disney+, other companies are entering this market. A notable example is Mercado Libre, which has started offering free movies within its platform. This move demonstrates how companies are recognizing the importance of streaming and are seeking to offer additional services to attract and retain users.",
    "text28-content-blog-post9":"In conclusion, technology, marketing, and artificial intelligence are advancing towards a world where the user experience is the central focus. Streaming platforms have not only transformed the way we consume entertainment but are also influencing other industries to adopt similar user-centric models. This change represents a significant evolution in the market, where innovation and adaptability are key to success.",
